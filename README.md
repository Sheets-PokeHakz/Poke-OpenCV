# OpenCV Pokétwo Finder

Helper to identify Pokétwo spawns with OpenCV.

This script uses OpenCV's feature matching algorithm to determine which pokemon is in the *Source* image. It was originally planned to be an automatic catcher for the [Pokétwo](https://poketwo.net/) discord bot a long time ago but i abandoned that idea as i don't find any need for such tool, not to add the risk of getting banned from using Pokétwo (and discord, if it was implemented into a self-bot).
